# Avatar: The Last Air Bender Clicky Game

## Overview
This is a memory game created with React. The app renders different images of characters from Avatar: The Last Airbender (ATLA). The objective of the game is to click each image only once. The user's score increments when clicking an image for teh first time and resets to zero if the same image is clicked more than once. To make this tricky, each time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in random order. When the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
